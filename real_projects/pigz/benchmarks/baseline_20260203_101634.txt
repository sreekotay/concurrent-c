# pigz Benchmark Baseline Snapshot
# Date: $(date)
# Purpose: Pre-ordered-channels baseline
# Config: 50MB input, 8 workers, 3 runs, CC_WORKERS=16

=== Benchmark Summary (avg over 3 runs) ===
Implementation               Comp(s)    Comp(MB/s)       Ratio   Decomp(s)  Decomp(MB/s)
pigz (pthread)                 0.319         149.6       37.9%       0.088         543.9
pigz_cc (Concurrent-C)         0.326         146.1       37.9%       0.074         644.4

Notes:
- Compression: CC ~2% slower than pthread version
- Decompression: CC ~18% faster than pthread version  
- Correctness: Both pass
- This is the baseline BEFORE implementing ordered channels
