/*
 * Recipe: Channel Pipeline (Producer/Consumer)
 *
 * Demonstrates:
 *   - Nested nurseries for structured channel lifetime
 *   - closing(ch) on inner nursery closes channel when producers done
 *   - Consumer in outer nursery drains until close, then exits
 *   - Channel handles captured in closures
 *
 * Key insight: Nest producers inside closing() so channel closes
 * exactly when producers finish, while consumer keeps running.
